## PART 1 — WHAT KRUX IS

KRUX is a Kenya import compliance management platform for importers, clearing agents, and manufacturers. It tracks shipments through 8 Kenyan regulatory bodies (PPB, KEBS, PCPB, KEPHIS, EPRA, NEMA, KRA, WHO-GMP), enforces PVoC certificate deadlines, calculates landed costs in real-time, generates AI-powered compliance briefs, manages manufacturer vetting, and automates compliance action generation with effectiveness tracking.

### Problem being solved
Kenya importers miss PVoC deadlines because they have no single system that tracks all 8 regulators, calculates real storage penalty costs, and tells them exactly what to do next. A missed deadline at PPB (45-day SLA) on a $100K shipment can cost KES 650,000+ in demurrage.

### Target customers (first tier)
- Clearing agent firms (they manage shipments for multiple importers — one sale = multiplied volume)
- Mid-size importers ($500K–$5M annual import value, 10–50 shipments/year)

### Target customers (second tier — build toward)
- Large importers (Bidco, Kapa Oil, Twiga Foods)
- Enterprise (Safaricom, multinationals) — needs API access tier

### Pricing (TEST mode — live requires Stripe live key rotation)
| Plan | Price | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Basic | $299/month | 25 shipments |
| Pro | $499/month | 100 shipments |
| Enterprise | $1,500/month | Unlimited |

## PART 7 — CORE LOGIC ENGINES

### Risk Engine (`src/lib/risk-engine.ts`)
Calculates risk score 0–10 per shipment using three factors:
- **timeFactor**: exponential urgency — `exp(-days/7)`. 14d=0.1, 7d=0.5, 3d=0.9, 0d=1.0
- **moneyFactor**: log-normalized CIF value — `log10(cif)/6`. $1K=0.2, $10K=0.4, $100K=0.6, $1M=0.8
- **probFactor**: compound delay probability across pending portals — joint: `1 - Π(1 - p_i)`

Hard floor overrides: ≤0d → 9.5, ≤3d → 7.5, ≤7d → 4.0

Priority levels: CRITICAL (≥7), HIGH (≥4), MEDIUM (≥1.5), LOW (<1.5)

Also checks SLA feasibility: if deadline < regulator's minimum processing time, adds human-readable risk driver like "PPB requires ≥45d to process — physically impossible to clear on time".

Regulator SLA benchmarks: KEBS=14d, PPB=45d, KEPHIS=7d, PCPB=21d, EPRA=14d, NEMA=30d, KRA=3d, KENTRADE=2d

### Action Generator (`src/lib/action-generator.ts`)
5 rules that auto-create compliance actions on shipment creation or portal status change:

1. **Submit documents** — for every NOT_STARTED portal. Priority CRITICAL (≤3d), HIGH (≤7d), MEDIUM otherwise
2. **Escalate** — if compound delay probability >70%
3. **Follow up** — if ≤3 days left and portals still IN_PROGRESS
4. **Verify HS code** — if CIF ≥$50K and no HS code set
5. **Preemptive submission** — for slow regulators (PPB, KEBS, PCPB) when 10–21 days out

Deduplication: checks open actions before creating — suppresses duplicates to `suppressed_actions` table with reason + context snapshot.

On escalation: if an ESCALATE_SHIPMENT action already exists, upgrades it to CRITICAL instead of creating a duplicate.

### Action Evaluator (`src/lib/action-evaluator.ts`)
Runs on a time-window per action type (VERIFY_HS_CODE=3d, SUBMIT_DOCUMENTS=7d, ESCALATE=21d, etc.)

Three completion signals:
- **EXPLICIT** (1.0 weight) — user marked done
- **INFERRED** (0.85 weight) — portal status advanced after action created
- **TIMEOUT** (0.5 weight) — window elapsed, no signal

Effectiveness formula (for document submission):
```
relativeImprovement = (baseline_days - actual_days) / baseline_days
effectiveness = clamp(0.6 + relativeImprovement × 0.4, 0.1, 1.0)
```
Examples with baseline=5d: actual=2d → 0.84, actual=5d → 0.60, actual=8d → 0.36

Updates org-specific `action_effectiveness_model` using confidence-weighted Bayesian average with running std_deviation and 95% confidence intervals.

### Event Engine (`src/lib/event-engine.ts`)
Processes three event types:
- **SHIPMENT_CREATED** → calls action generator + risk engine
- **PORTAL_STATUS_CHANGED** → if REJECTED: flags RED, creates escalation action, records portal outcome; if APPROVED: checks if all portals clear → sets GREEN
- **DEADLINE_APPROACHING** → sends HTML email via Resend with KES cost estimate, action required text, severity color coding

Deadline alert tiers: 3d (CRITICAL), 7d (URGENT), 14d (WARNING). Each tier fires once per shipment (tracked by `alert_sent_3d_at` etc.)

Email template: KRUX-branded dark HTML with shipment summary, days remaining, estimated missed-deadline cost in KES, and specific regulator action text.

### Alert Engine (`src/lib/alerts.ts`)
Client-side deadline computation for in-app alert banners. Triggers on shipments within 14 days. Computes estimated additional cost in KES using storage_rate_per_day × kesRate. Sorted by urgency ascending.

### Document AI Extraction (`src/app/api/documents/extract/route.ts`)
Accepts PDF or image file (max 10MB). Sends base64 to Claude Sonnet 4.6 with Kenya compliance specialist system prompt. Returns structured JSON with: name, hs_code, origin_port, origin_country, destination_port, product_description, quantity, unit, weight_kg, cif_value_usd, bl_number, vessel_name, document_type. These fields auto-populate the Add Shipment form.

### Part 9B — Landing Page (`/`) — rebuilt 2026-04-24

**Purpose:** Self-sells the product to prospects without requiring a human to explain it.

**Sections in order:**

1. **Nav** — KRUX logo, "Sign in" link, "Request Access" CTA (anchors to waitlist)

2. **Hero**
   - Headline: "Stop losing money to missed PVoC deadlines"
   - Subheadline explains 8 regulators + AI alerts + cost consequences
   - Link: "Calculate what your last missed deadline actually cost →" (opens cost calculator modal)
   - Two CTAs: "Request Early Access" + "Sign in to dashboard"
   - Three stat cards: KES 546K+ (cost of missing PPB deadline on $50K shipment), 8 bodies, 45 days (PPB minimum SLA)

3. **Dashboard Mockup** — CSS replica of the live operations dashboard showing:
   - 4 realistic Kenya shipments with RED/AMBER/GREEN risk badges
   - Risk scores (9.2, 6.1, 3.8, 1.4), priority labels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Alert banner: "CRITICAL: Pharmaceutical APIs — PPB deadline in 3 days. Est. loss if missed: KES 546,300"
   - Landed costs in USD, regulator badges, days remaining column
   - Browser chrome (fake URL bar showing the actual dashboard URL)

4. **Problem → Solution** — X marks vs checkmarks
   - Left (Without KRUX): 5 pain points with red X
   - Right (With KRUX): 5 solutions with green checkmarks

5. **Regulators** — All 8 regulators in pill grid with SLA context: "KRUX knows PPB needs 45 days. It tells you when a deadline is physically impossible to meet."

6. **Features** — 6-card grid (Compliance Tracking, AI Assistant, Alerts, Manufacturer Vault, Landed Cost, Action Intelligence)

7. **Who it's for** — 3 cards: Clearing Agents (tagged "Best fit"), SME Importers, Supply Chain Managers

8. **Pricing** — 3 plans matching live billing page exactly:
   - Basic $299/mo — 25 shipments (fixed from previous incorrect "10")
   - Pro $499/mo — 100 shipments (Most Popular)
   - Enterprise $1,500/mo — Unlimited

9. **Waitlist form** — Email + company name, submits to `/api/waitlist`, success state shows 24h response time

10. **Footer** — Terms, Privacy, Sign in links

**Cost Calculator Modal** (triggered from hero link):
- Inputs: CIF value (USD), days past deadline, import duty rate (%)
- Calculates: storage charges (0.5% CIF/day), late penalties (2% CIF/day after day 7)
- Output: line-by-line breakdown → total in KES
- Closing line: "KRUX Basic ($299/mo) would have prevented this entire cost."
- Closes on backdrop click or X button

---

## PART 11 — USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| `krux_admin` | Full platform access across all orgs |
| `operations` | Shipment management, actions, compliance, full write |
| `management` | Analytics and reporting, read-only |
| `clearing_agent` | Only assigned shipments |
| `client` | Client-facing view only |
| `manufacturer` | Manufacturer vault, own records |

---

## PART 12 — STRIPE INTEGRATION (full detail)

### Products & Prices (TEST mode)
| Plan | Stripe Product | Price ID | Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| KRUX Basic | prod_xxx | `price_1TPnPaBo2cn6fl3lFIjBPruc` | $299/month |
| KRUX Pro | prod_xxx | `price_1TPnPcBo2cn6fl3ldBgoHcU9` | $499/month |
| KRUX Enterprise | prod_xxx | `price_1TPnPeBo2cn6fl3l6iQiX2QU` | $1,500/month |

### Checkout flow
1. User clicks "Upgrade to Pro" on `/dashboard/billing`
2. POST `/api/payments/checkout` with `{ plan: 'pro' }`
3. Route looks up `stripe_customer_id` on org — creates Stripe customer if missing, saves ID back to org
4. Creates Checkout Session with success_url and cancel_url
5. Returns `{ url }` → client redirects
6. After payment: `checkout.session.completed` webhook → updates org in Supabase

### Webhook events handled
| Event | What happens |
|---|---|
| `checkout.session.completed` | Retrieves subscription, calls `updateOrg(orgId, plan, subId, priceId, expires)` |
| `invoice.paid` | Renews subscription period |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Downgrades to trial, limit → 5 shipments |

### Plan limits written to org on subscription
| Plan | `subscription_tier` | `monthly_shipment_limit` |
|---|---|---|
| basic | `basic` | 25 |
| pro | `pro` | 100 |
| enterprise | `enterprise` | 9999 |
| cancelled | `trial` | 5 |

### Billing portal
POST `/api/payments/portal` → Stripe Billing Portal session → user can cancel, update card, view invoices

---

## PART 13 — SCRIPTS

| Script | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `setup-stripe.js` | `node scripts/setup-stripe.js` | Creates 3 Stripe products + monthly prices if not exist. Patches `.env.local` with price IDs. Prints webhook registration instructions |
| `push-vercel-env.js` | `node scripts/push-vercel-env.js` | Reads `.env.local`, upserts all keys to Vercel via REST API, triggers production redeploy from GitHub source |
| `test-billing.js` | `node scripts/test-billing.js` | 7 checks: app reachable, billing page loads, checkout endpoint exists, webhook endpoint exists, Stripe products exist, price IDs configured, webhook registered. Last result: **7/7 passed** |
| `migrate.js` | `node scripts/migrate.js` | Applies SQL migration files to production Supabase in order |

## PART 15 — WHAT IS BLOCKED (requires action)

| Feature | Blocked by | Action to unblock |
|---|---|---|
| WhatsApp morning brief + inbound commands | Twilio env vars not set. **Backend fully built** — `/api/whatsapp/inbound` handles status/done/snooze/help. Just needs 4 env vars in Vercel. | Add `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM`, `ALERT_WHATSAPP_TO` to Vercel. Set Twilio sandbox webhook URL to `https://krux-xi.vercel.app/api/whatsapp/inbound`. User must add their WhatsApp number in Settings. |
| WhatsApp deadline alerts | Same | Same |
| Stripe LIVE mode | Using test keys | Rotate to live Stripe key, re-run `setup-stripe.js` against live, register new webhook |
| Welcome email from real domain | ~~Resend `from:` was unverified~~ — **FIXED Session 5**: `kruxvon.com` verified, all emails send from `@kruxvon.com` | ✅ Done |
| EPRA SLA accuracy | Unverified — currently 25d in code | Verify against epra.go.ke before KRA demo |

---

## PART 16 — WHAT IS NOT BUILT YET

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| WhatsApp alerts + inbound | Full backend built (outbound deadline alerts + inbound status/done/snooze/help). Twilio not wired. 4 env vars needed + webhook URL set in Twilio console. |
| Real-time portal scraping | Manual status entry only — would need KenTrade/KEBS API or scheduled browser scraping |
| API access tier | Planned for Enterprise — no API key management built |
| Revenue share module | For audit agencies — referenced in types, not built |
| Cron automation | Vercel cron jobs configured in `vercel.json` (4 jobs). Must verify they fire correctly with `CRON_SECRET`. |
| Mobile native app | Mobile-optimized web view exists at `/dashboard/mobile` |
| Multi-entity support | Listed in Enterprise features on billing page, not implemented |
| Custom domain | Still on `krux-xi.vercel.app` — needs `.co.ke` or `.io` for enterprise credibility |
| Resend verified sender domain | Welcome/alert emails come from unverified domain — likely spam-filtered |

---

## PART 17 — SECURITY NOTES

### Keys exposed during development — MUST rotate before going LIVE
| Key | Incident | Status |
|---|---|---|
| First Stripe secret key | Pasted in chat conversation | Revoked — new key generated |
| Second Stripe secret key | Accidentally run as PowerShell terminal command | **Verify revoked** in Stripe dashboard before go-live |

### General security posture
- All server-only keys (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`) are never exposed to the browser
- RLS enforces org isolation — even if a user guesses another org's shipment ID, they get 0 rows
- Stripe webhook uses signature verification (`constructEvent`) — rejects unsigned requests with 400
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` is local-only and never pushed to Vercel (would be a privilege escalation vector)
- `CRON_SECRET` is set and should be used to protect any automated cron endpoints

---

### Session 5 (mobile + email fixes)
| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Sidebar hamburger menu | `Sidebar.tsx` rewritten — `translate-x-[-100%]` on mobile, hamburger button top-left, backdrop overlay, closes on nav click |
| Layout `ml-60` fix | Changed to `lg:ml-60` + `pt-14 lg:pt-0` so content clears hamburger on all dashboard pages |

### Session 4 (critical signup fix)
| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| **ROOT CAUSE FOUND: `subscription_tier: 'free'`** | DB enum is `('trial','basic','pro','enterprise')` — every org insert was failing with PostgreSQL enum violation since launch |
| Fixed in `/api/activate/route.ts` | `'free'` → `'trial'` |
| Fixed in `/signup/actions.ts` | `'free'` → `'trial'` |
| Onboarding false-progress fixed | Filters demo shipments by ref pattern, known demo manufacturer names |
| Operations page: auto-set `krux_auto_seeded` flag | Detects server-seeded demo data on first load |
| Git push to GitHub (master) | Commit `65eda90` |
| Vercel deployed via `npx vercel --prod` | `dpl_pt4Qak1zNifzeUuqg2HA3HPBLmkn` — READY |
| **Two real leads lost to the bug** | `HQ@ELEMENT72VITALITY.COM` (Element72 Vitality), `haaji1242@gmail.com` — must reach out |

### Now unblocked (needs your input only)
1. **Wire Twilio WhatsApp** — entire backend is built. Provide 4 values: `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` (e.g. `whatsapp:+14155238886`), `ALERT_WHATSAPP_TO` (your +254 number). Also set webhook URL in Twilio console to `https://krux-xi.vercel.app/api/whatsapp/inbound`. Done in 5 minutes.
2. **Custom domain** — pick/buy `krux.co.ke` or `kruxapp.io`. I do the Vercel config + Resend sender swap. Needed before any enterprise demo.
3. **Stripe live mode** — billing page now has 5-step guide. Rotate to live keys, re-run `setup-stripe.js`, register live webhook.

### Level-up roadmap (remaining sprints)

**Sprint 7 ✅ DONE** — Client Portfolio, Bulk CSV Import, Client Share Links

**Sprint 8 ✅ DONE** — WhatsApp inbound commands (status/done/snooze/help), whatsapp_number in Settings

**Sprint 9 (partial)** — Weekly digest ✅, Regulator performance ✅, Billing go-live guide ✅. Still to do:
- Stripe LIVE mode rotation (user action + `node scripts/setup-stripe.js`)
- Predictive delay scoring — surface "PPB is running 60d this month" from real `regulator_delay_profiles` data

### After product-market fit confirmed
- WhatsApp Business API (move off Twilio sandbox to official BSP when volume justifies)
- API access tier — key management for Enterprise
- Multi-entity support (listed in Enterprise features, not built)

---

## PART 20 — CRITICAL BUGS FIXED (log)

| Bug | Impact | Root Cause | Fix | Session |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `subscription_tier: 'free'` | **Every single real user signup failed since launch** — returned "Account setup failed" or "Something went wrong" | `organizations` table uses PostgreSQL enum `('trial','basic','pro','enterprise')`. Code inserted `'free'` which doesn't exist. PostgreSQL rejected with enum violation. | Changed to `'trial'` in both `/api/activate` and `/signup/actions.ts` | 4 |
| `seedDemoData` not in try/catch | `/api/activate` returned 500 if demo seeding threw, even though account was created | Exception from `seedDemoData` propagated to outer catch block | Wrapped in try/catch (non-fatal) | 3 |
| "Already exists" on retry → locked out | Demo user who retried got `{ exists: true }` → redirected to login — but their password was an unknown random string | No recovery path for partial activation | On "already exists": find user via `admin.listUsers`, reset password, return new temp password | 3 |
| Onboarding shows 60–80% on fresh signup | New users feel they've already done setup — misleading | Demo data (seeded server-side on signup) satisfied the shipment + manufacturer completion checks | Filter demo shipments by ref pattern (`KRUX-YYYY-LETTERS-` = demo), filter known demo manufacturer names | 4 |
| Hardcoded URL in morning brief | Morning brief WhatsApp message linked to wrong URL in some environments | `briefText.slice(0, 1450) + '\n\n[Full brief at https://krux-xi.vercel.app/dashboard]'` | Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` env var | 3 |
